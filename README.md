# Maid Made Maze Mod Tools

This game uses a weird format called <code>.tpf</code> to store it's data, and since none of the tools I found online worked I made some tools to extract and modify game assets.

This is still a work-in-progress. So far i've only managed to extract images from the <code>image00.tpf</code> file.
